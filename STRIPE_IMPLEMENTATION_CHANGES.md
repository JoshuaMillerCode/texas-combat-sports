# Stripe Implementation Changes Summary

## What Changed

Your checkout was originally configured to use **Stripe Connect** with application fees, but the webhook implementation uses **Stripe Transfers**. These are two different approaches that conflict with each other.

### ‚ùå Old Approach (Stripe Connect - REMOVED)

**In `app/api/checkout/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// This was removed ‚ùå
payment_intent_data: {
  application_fee_amount: applicationFeeAmount,
  on_behalf_of: process.env.ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID,
  transfer_data: {
    destination: process.env.ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID,
  },
}
```

**Flow:**

1. Your PLATFORM account charges the customer
2. You take 4% as `application_fee_amount`
3. You transfer the remaining 96% to the organizer
4. Requires: Stripe Connect setup, platform account

**Environment variable removed:**

- `ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` ‚ùå

### ‚úÖ New Approach (Stripe Transfers - IMPLEMENTED)

**In `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// This is now active ‚úÖ
case 'checkout.session.completed':
  // Create 4% transfer to developer account
  await TransferService.createServiceFeeTransfer(
    paymentIntentId,
    totalAmount,
    transactionId
  );
```

**Flow:**

1. CLIENT's account charges the customer
2. Client receives 100% of payment into their balance
3. Webhook automatically transfers 4% to your account
4. Requires: Only your account ID, no Connect setup

**Environment variable needed:**

- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` ‚úÖ (your Stripe account ID)

## Why This Change Was Necessary

The two approaches are **mutually exclusive**:

| Aspect                | Connect (Old)             | Transfers (New)          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Who charges customer? | Platform (you)            | Client                   |
| When does fee happen? | During charge             | After charge (webhook)   |
| Setup complexity      | High (Connect onboarding) | Low (just account ID)    |
| Client control        | Limited                   | Full                     |
| Refund handling       | Automatic fee reversal    | Manual transfer reversal |

**The problem:** You can't use both at once. The checkout was taking 4% as a Connect fee, then the webhook would try to transfer another 4%, resulting in 8% total fees! üêõ

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/api/checkout/route.ts`

**Removed:**

- Application fee calculation
- `payment_intent_data` with Connect configuration
- `ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` validation
- Connect-related debug logging

**Result:** Clean checkout that charges the full amount to client's account

### 2. `STRIPE_TRANSFER_SETUP.md`

**Updated:**

- Added warning section explaining the difference
- Removed Connect setup instructions
- Clarified that this uses simple transfers, not Connect
- Removed references to `ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID`

## Environment Variables Update

### Remove These:

```bash
# No longer needed ‚ùå
ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_XXXXX
```

### Keep These:

```bash
# Client's Stripe account (receives payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51XXXXX

# Webhook verification
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXXX

# Your account (receives 4% transfers)
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=acct_XXXXX  # ‚Üê Your developer account ID
```

## How It Works Now

```
Step 1: Checkout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Customer pays $100
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client's Stripe account receives $100
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Payment intent created

Step 2: Webhook (checkout.session.completed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Webhook receives event
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates transaction in database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generates and emails tickets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Creates transfer: $4 to SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID

Step 3: Result
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client has: $96 in balance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ You have: $4 in balance

Step 4: Refund (if needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Webhook receives charge.refunded event
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Updates transaction status
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reverses transfer: Returns $4 (or proportional amount)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:

- [ ] Remove `ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID` from `.env.local`
- [ ] Add `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` with YOUR account ID
- [ ] Redeploy the application
- [ ] Update webhook in Stripe Dashboard (if URL changed)

### Test Flow:

1. **Create checkout** ‚Üí Should charge full amount (no fee deducted)
2. **Complete payment** ‚Üí Check logs for "Creating service fee transfer"
3. **Check Stripe Dashboard** ‚Üí Verify transfer appears
4. **Issue refund** ‚Üí Check logs for "Reversing service fee transfer"
5. **Check Dashboard** ‚Üí Verify transfer reversal appears

### Expected Logs:

```bash
# On successful checkout:
‚úÖ Checkout session created: { sessionId: '...', totalAmountCents: 10000 }
Creating service fee transfer for ticket order: { paymentIntentId: '...', totalAmount: 10000 }
Service fee transfer created: tr_XXXXX

# On refund:
Charge refunded: { chargeId: '...', refundAmount: 10000 }
Found transaction for refund: 6789...
Reversing service fee transfer: { transferId: 'tr_XXXXX' }
Service fee transfer reversed: trr_XXXXX
```

## Migration Path (If You Want Connect Instead)

If you prefer the Connect approach over transfers:

1. **Revert checkout changes** (add back `payment_intent_data`)
2. **Remove transfer webhook logic**
3. **Set up Stripe Connect** platform account
4. **Use `application_fee_amount`** for fees
5. **Add `ORGANIZER_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID`** back

However, **transfers are simpler** for your use case because:

- No platform onboarding
- Client maintains control
- Easier to set up and maintain
- Webhook handles everything

## Questions?

**Q: Which approach is better?**
A: Transfers (current implementation) is simpler. Use Connect only if you need advanced features like payouts, identity verification, or card issuing.

**Q: Can I change the fee percentage?**
A: Yes! Edit `lib/services/transfer.service.ts` and change `SERVICE_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 4` to any value.

**Q: What if transfer fails?**
A: Webhook won't fail (returns 200). Transfer is marked as 'failed' in database. You can manually create transfer in Stripe Dashboard.

**Q: Do I need Stripe Connect?**
A: No! This implementation uses simple transfers between accounts. No Connect setup needed.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Removed conflicting Connect configuration from checkout  
‚úÖ **Active:** Transfer-based fee collection via webhook  
‚úÖ **Simpler:** No Connect setup required  
‚úÖ **Cleaner:** Single source of truth for 4% fee

The implementation is now consistent and uses the simpler transfer approach throughout! üöÄ
